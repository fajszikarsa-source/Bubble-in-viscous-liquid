## Numerical & Analytical Modeling of Bubble Ascent
This project simulates the nonlinear ascent of nitrogen bubbles in viscous fluids, accounting for buoyancy, gravity, and drag forces.

### Technical Documentation
* Requires a **C++14 GNU C++** compiler or newer (developed and tested in Code::Blocks).
* An online version is available at [ide.usaco.guide/0Je3kxlvm_VYd3hoL7Z](https://ide.usaco.guide/0Je3kxlvm_VYd3hoL7Z).
Unfortunately it is a partial version, it lacks the runtime prediction module and will terminate after 5 seconds due to the execution limits of the online platform.
* All physical constants are defined at the beginning of the source code.

Note: I'm making this repo (and my application in general) while the Ortvay competition is running so I'm not going to translate the files to English (I'd rather spend time thinking about those problems). This mostly functions as proof that I actually made the projects I mentioned in my CV. Either way, I'd be surprised if the person responsible for sorting through applications had enough time to properly look at my code.
